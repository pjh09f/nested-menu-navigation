  <h1>Adele's 21 Album</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph on Adele's second album -->
  <p>
    <em>21</em> is one of the most famous breakup albums of all time. There’s rage, grief, denial, acceptance — sometimes all in one track. Interestingly, "Set Fire to the Rain" literally came from Adele trying to light a cigarette in the rain. That image stuck with her and became the foundation for one of the most emotional, dramatic songs on the album. And that’s the magic of <em>21</em> — it takes fleeting moments and turns them into full-blown epics. "Rolling in the Deep" hits like thunder, while "Someone Like You" is all ache and aftermath. It’s no surprise this album broke records and won six Grammys. It feels universal and deeply personal.
