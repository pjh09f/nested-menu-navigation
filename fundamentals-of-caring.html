  <!-- brief description of the film and its tone -->
   <p>
   <em>The Fundamentals of Caring</em> follows a sarcastic caregiver and a teen with muscular dystrophy as they hit the road for a makeshift bucket list trip. What starts as a pity job turns into something deeper — a weird, funny, unexpectedly touching story about connection, grief, and the awkward stuff in between. It balances emotional moments with sharp humor, and somehow manages to be both low-key and genuinely inspiring. Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts have great chemistry, and the movie never tries too hard — which is part of why it lands so well.
