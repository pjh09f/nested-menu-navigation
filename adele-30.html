  <h1>Adele's 30 Album</h1>

  <!-- Adele's most recent album and residency in Vegas! -->
  <p>
    Adele's <em>30</em> album highlights divorce, motherhood, anxiety, and growth, which is highlighted by her Saturn tattoo and the strong symbolism the number 30 holds related to growth as well. "To Be Loved" is the kind of song you almost feel guilty listening to because it’s so raw, like you’ve accidentally walked in on something private. It was recorded in a single take! And you can hear her cracking open as she sings it. She started her Las Vegas residency not long after <em>30</em> came out, despite the postponing incident. And if you’ve never heard "Can’t Be Together" from the deluxe edition — do. It’s heartbreaking but inspirational. <em>30</em> is heavy, but healing. Lastly, "Hold On" is very much the backbone of that theme.
