  <h1>Adele's 30 Album</h1>

  <!-- Adele's most recent album and residency in Vegas! -->
  <p>
    <em>30</em> is Adele laid bare. Divorce, motherhood, anxiety, growth — it’s all there, unfiltered and soaring. "To Be Loved" is the kind of song you almost feel guilty listening to because it’s so raw, like you’ve accidentally walked in on something private. It was recorded in a single take, and you can hear her cracking open as she sings it. She started her Las Vegas residency not long after <em>30</em> came out, turning the album’s heartbreak into a shared, live catharsis. And if you’ve never heard "Can’t Be Together" from the deluxe edition — do. It’s heartbreak distilled. <em>30</em> is heavy, but in the way that truth is heavy — and healing.
