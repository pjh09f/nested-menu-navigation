    <!-- summary of the film -->
    <p>
    <em>You're Not You</em> follows a classical pianist (played by Hilary Swank) who’s diagnosed with ALS, and the college dropout (Emmy Rossum) who becomes her unconventional caregiver. It’s one of those films that’s not about “overcoming illness” so much as it is about holding on to personhood when everything else starts to change. Their dynamic is messy, funny, frustrating, and deeply human. The music, the moments of care, the loss of control — it all hits a little harder than expected, and stays with you longer than you’d think.
