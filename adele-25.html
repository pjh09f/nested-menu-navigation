  <h1>Adele's 25 Album</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph on Adele's 2nd album plus 'Hello' backstory -->
  <p>
    <em>25</em> isn’t a sequel to <em>21</em> — it comes from another angle. "Hello" sounds like it’s addressed to an ex, but Adele later said it was actually a message to her younger self — which somehow makes it even more emotional. There’s a deep sense of reflection across the whole album, like someone looking back and making peace with the things they once tried to outrun. The deluxe edition hides one of her most underrated songs: "Can’t Let Go," which is devastating in its simplicity. <em>25</em> may not scream like <em>21</em>, but it stays with you in a different way — softer, sadder, and a little more grown up.
