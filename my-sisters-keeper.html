  <h1>My Sister's Keeper</h1>

<!-- emotional summary of the film -->
<p>
<em>My Sister’s Keeper</em> is the kind of movie that leaves you gutted in the best way. It tells the story of a young girl who was conceived to be a genetic match for her sister, who has leukemia — and what happens when she decides she wants a say in her own body. The film explores medical ethics, family dynamics, and the unspoken emotional toll of caretaking. It’s heavy, but it’s also tender and layered, with performances that hit harder than you expect. Bring tissues.
