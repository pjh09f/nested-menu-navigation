  <h1>Queer Icons</h1>
<!-- brief intro to the significance of queer icons in history -->
    <p>
    Queer icons aren’t just celebrities — they’re people who stood up, stood out, and helped carve space for others in a world that didn’t always want them to exist. Some were activists, others were artists, and many were both without even trying. These figures shaped queer culture through courage, creativity, and authenticity, often at great personal cost. Here are just a few.

    <!-- 4 of the notable icons represented in pic -->
    <p><strong>Marsha P. Johnson:</strong> A trans activist and drag queen who played a key role in the Stonewall uprising. She famously said, “No pride for some of us without liberation for all of us.”</p>
    <p><strong>Freddie Mercury:</strong> Lead singer of Queen, known for his flamboyance, incredible range, and refusal to fit in. He died of AIDS-related illness in 1991, but remains a queer legend in music.</p>
    <p><strong>Sylvester:</strong> A trailblazing gender-nonconforming disco singer whose hits like “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” became anthems of queer joy and freedom.</p>
    <p><strong>Keith Haring:</strong> A graffiti-inspired artist and activist whose work tackled AIDS, love, and social justice through bright, bold figures and street art.</p>
