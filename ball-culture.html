  <h1>Ball Culture</h1>

  <!-- brief historical and cultural description of ball and voguing culture -->
  <p>
    Ball culture began as a radical form of self-expression and survival for Black and Latinx queer people in 1970s and 80s New York. It offered a space to walk, compete, and exist outside of a world that didn’t see or value them. Voguing — with its sharp poses and fluid movements — emerged from this scene, inspired by fashion magazines but shaped by protest, resilience, and joy. Today, ball culture continues to evolve, spotlighted in shows like <em>Pose</em> and celebrated globally. But its roots remain sacred: a defiant celebration of chosen family, gender creativity, and being seen.
