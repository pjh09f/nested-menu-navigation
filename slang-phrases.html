  <h1>Slang Phrases</h1>

    <!-- intro paragraph celebrating the diversity and cultural roots of queer slang -->
    <p>
    Queer slang is more than just witty catchphrases — it's part survival, part expression, and part joy. From drag balls and Black queer communities to trans TikTokers and sapphic friend groups, LGBTQ+ people have created and shared language that helps us find each other, affirm identity, and throw shade (when necessary). It’s always evolving, often hilarious, and deeply tied to culture and resistance.

    <!-- brief breakdown of a range of terms across different queer subcultures -->
    <p><strong>Tea:</strong> The truth, gossip, or story. As in “Spill the tea.”</p>
    <p><strong>Butch/Femme:</strong> Gendered expressions often used in lesbian and queer spaces, describing presentation more than identity.</p>
    <p><strong>Read:</strong> To call someone out — often harshly, but truthfully — usually used in drag and ballroom culture.</p>
    <p><strong>Soft masc:</strong> A queer shorthand often used by nonbinary or transmasc folks for a masculine vibe that’s chill, not aggressive.</p>
    <p><strong>Gay panic:</strong> That flustered feeling when a hot person of the same gender catches you off guard — now a meme, always relatable.</p>
