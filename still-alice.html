    <!-- overview of the film -->
    <p>
    <em>Still Alice</em> tells the story of a linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s — a terrifying reality for someone whose life has been built around language. The film doesn’t rely on melodrama; it hits hard because it’s quiet, patient, and real. Julianne Moore’s performance is devastating and precise — she doesn’t play the disease, she plays a person trying to hold on to herself while it slips away. It’s a film that stays with you — especially the little moments, like trying to remember a word or a face that used to feel familiar.
