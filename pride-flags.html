  <h1>Pride Flags</h1>
<!-- paragraph overview of many pride flags and what they represent -->
<p>
    Pride flags aren’t just colorful decorations — they’re powerful symbols of identity, visibility, and community. Each flag in the photo below represents a different slice of the LGBTQ+ spectrum, telling its own story through color and design. They’ve become essential markers at marches, events, and online spaces — a way to say “I see you” without saying a word.

    <!-- brief notes on each flag shown in the image -->
    <p><strong>Rainbow Flag:</strong> The original and most recognized pride flag. It represents the full LGBTQ+ community and was designed by Gilbert Baker in 1978.</p>
    <p><strong>Transgender Flag:</strong> Light blue, pink, and white stripes represent trans men, trans women, and nonbinary individuals. Created by Monica Helms in 1999.</p>
    <p><strong>Nonbinary Flag:</strong> Yellow, white, purple, and black — each color representing a different experience of gender outside the binary.</p>
    <p><strong>Bisexual Flag:</strong> Pink, purple, and blue stand for same-gender attraction, attraction to multiple genders, and the overlap in between.</p>
    <p><strong>Progress Flag:</strong> A modern redesign that includes stripes for Black and Brown queer people, as well as trans people — pushing forward inclusion within the LGBTQ+ movement.</p>
