  <h1>Adele's 19 Album</h1>
  <p>
    <em>19</em> is Adele before the fame, but not before the depth. "Hometown Glory," the first song she ever wrote, came together in ten minutes after a fight with her mum — she didn’t want to leave London, and instead of arguing, she poured it all into that track. That stubborn love for home and identity still anchors the album. Songs like "Chasing Pavements" and "Daydreamer" feel like pages from someone’s journal, sung out loud before they realized anyone else might hear. It’s raw and young, yes, but also timeless. You can already hear the storytelling instincts that would make her a global voice — even back when she was just telling her own small, true stories.
